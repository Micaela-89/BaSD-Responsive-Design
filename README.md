# 'Become a Software Developer' - WEEK 3 PROJECT  - Responsive Design.'

The objective of this week project is to create the cover of a newspaper (main page), putting together my own cover design using FlexBox as the main tool for creating a Responsive Design, and following the Mobile First concept. 

## Description
 The cover must contain:
 - Name of the newspaper.
 - Date.
 - Main news with images, title, brief description and link to the news.
 - Secondary news (with or without image), the title and link to the news.
 - A navigation menu to the different sections of the newspaper and advertisements.
 
  It is not requested that the links of the news, advertisements or navigation menu lead anywhere.
  The main menu should be a horizontal bar with links when viewed from a desktop PC, but when looking at the web from a mobile phone the horizontal bar should disappear and only the “hamburger” icon should be displayed. (It's not requested to be clickable since that is solved with JavaScript).

### Executing
